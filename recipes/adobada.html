    <p class="para"><strong>Tacos de adobada</strong> (Also known as "Tacos al Pastor" or "Tacos de trompo"), a beloved Mexican street food, have a rich and fascinating history. Their origins can be traced back to the 1920s and 1930s when Lebanese immigrants settled in Mexico. These immigrants brought with them the culinary tradition of shawarma, a method of cooking meat on a vertical rotisserie. Over time, Mexican cooks adapted this technique, using marinated pork instead of the traditional lamb or beef. This led to the creation of what we now know as tacos de adobada.</p>
    <p class="para">The preparation of tacos de adobada involves marinating thinly sliced pork in a flavorful mixture of spices, including achiote paste, citrus juices, and various aromatic herbs. The marinated meat is then stacked onto a vertical rotisserie, where it slowly cooks and caramelizes as it spins, creating tender, succulent layers of meat. As the outer layer cooks, it's shaved off and served in warm corn tortillas, typically garnished with diced onions, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime. Some variations may also include pineapple, adding a sweet and tangy contrast to the savory pork.</p>
    <p class="para">Tacos de adobada hold great significance in Mexican culinary culture. They have become an iconic representation of the blending of Middle Eastern and Mexican culinary traditions. The dish's popularity has transcended borders, gaining recognition and admiration worldwide. In Mexico, taco stands and restaurants specializing in adobada are ubiquitous, serving as a quintessential part of the country's street food scene. This dish has become an essential part of Mexican gastronomy, reflecting the country's diverse cultural influences and its ability to transform foreign culinary traditions into something uniquely Mexican.</p>

    <h2 class="sec-header adobada">Steps to prepare Tacos de Adobada</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a bowl, mix together achiote paste, vinegar, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, and chili powder to create a flavorful marinade. Adjust the quantities to your taste preferences.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Marinate the Pork:</strong> Cut the pork shoulder into thin slices. Coat each slice thoroughly with the marinade, ensuring even coverage. Place the marinated pork in a sealed container or a resealable bag, and refrigerate for at least 2-4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>     
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Prepare the Vertical Spit (Trompo):</strong> If you have a vertical rotisserie (trompo), set it up according to the manufacturer's instructions. Otherwise, you can use an alternative cooking method, such as grilling or roasting on skewers.</li>  
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Assemble the Tacos:</strong> While the pork is marinating, prepare your toppings. Dice the pineapple, chop the cilantro, and finely dice the onions. Arrange them in separate bowls for easy access.</li>  
        <li><strong>Cook the Pork:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li class="mini-list-item">If using a vertical spit, stack the marinated pork slices onto the skewer, alternating with slices of pineapple. As the spit rotates, the outer layers of meat will caramelize and develop a crispy texture.</li>
            <li class="mini-list-item">If using an alternative cooking method, thread the marinated pork and pineapple onto skewers and grill or roast until cooked through and slightly charred.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Slice and Serve:</strong> Once the pork is cooked, carefully slice thin strips from the outer layer of the meat. The interior should be juicy and flavorful.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Warm the Tortillas:</strong> Heat the corn tortillas on a griddle or in a dry skillet for about 30 seconds on each side, until they are warm and pliable.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Assemble the Tacos:</strong> Place a generous portion of the cooked pork onto each warm tortilla. Top with fresh cilantro, diced onions, and a slice of pineapple. Squeeze a lime wedge over the top for added zest.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Customize your tacos with your choice of salsa and any optional toppings like sliced radishes, guacamole, or hot sauce.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Serve and Enjoy!</strong> Serve the tacos al pastor hot and fresh, and savor the delicious blend of flavors and textures.</li>
