        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pho, a Vietnamese culinary masterpiece, is a savory and aromatic noodle soup that has gained international acclaim for its rich flavors and comforting warmth.

The meat is often added raw to the hot broth, allowing it to cook gently and maintain its tenderness. Fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and chili peppers are commonly served on the side, allowing diners to customize their bowls according to personal taste preferences.</p>
        <p>The taste of pho is a harmonious blend of savory, sweet, and aromatic notes, with the umami-rich broth serving as the centerpiece.

The rice noodles contribute a chewy texture, while the fresh herbs and condiments add a burst of freshness and a hint of heat. Pho is not only a culinary delight but also a cultural experience, reflecting the balance and harmony valued in Vietnamese cuisine.</p>
        <p>Beyond its delicious taste, pho is a symbol of Vietnamese culture and community.

While the exact genesis of pho remains somewhat shrouded in mystery, it is widely believed to have originated in the northern regions of Vietnam, around the Hanoi and Nam Dinh areas.

        <h2>Steps to prepare pho</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Broth:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Rinse the beef bones under cold water to remove any bone fragments. Place them in a large stockpot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and let it cook vigorously for about 10 minutes. This helps remove impurities. Discard the water and rinse the bones again.</li>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Return the bones to the pot and add enough water to cover them completely. Bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Char the Aromatics:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">While the bones are simmering, char the onion and ginger. You can do this over an open flame, on a grill, or under the broiler until they are well-charred on all sides. This imparts a smoky flavor to the broth.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Infuse the Broth with Spices:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">In a mesh bag or wrapped in cheesecloth, combine star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and coriander seeds. Add this spice bundle to the simmering broth.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Simmer the Broth:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Let the broth simmer gently for at least 4-6 hours, but longer if possible (up to 12 hours). This slow cooking process extracts all the flavors from the bones and spices, resulting in a rich and flavorful broth.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Season the Broth:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Add fish sauce, rock sugar (or granulated sugar), and salt to taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Noodles:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">While the broth is simmering, cook the rice noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Toppings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Slice the raw beef (brisket or sirloin) thinly. Arrange the bean sprouts, basil leaves, lime wedges, cilantro, chopped scallions, and Thai bird's eye chilies (if using) on a platter for serving.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the Pho:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">To serve, place a portion of cooked rice noodles in a bowl. Top with raw beef slices and ladle hot broth over the top. The hot broth will cook the beef.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Let diners customize their bowls with bean sprouts, fresh herbs, lime juice, scallions, and chilies. Add hoisin and sriracha to taste.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
