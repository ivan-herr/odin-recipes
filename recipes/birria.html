            <h1>Birria</h1>
            <p>Birria is one of the products that occured when both the Old World and the New World met. Using goat meat (Native to Europe, Asia, and Africa) and marinating the meat in indigenous styles, birria is one of the several, unintended consequences that came from the mixing of cultures. A truly Mexican dish in every sense of the word and a jewel of the Mexican melting pot, birria is beloved across Mexico but especially in its home state of Jalisco in its tradition form and Tijuana, where beef-style birria was born and is used for tacos de birria and quesabirrias.</p>
            <p>Like tacos de adobada/al pastor, birria is also beloved in the US as many taco stands and food trucks brought over tacos de birria to their respecitve cities. Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans slowly but surely took over border states and eventually the entirety of the country.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>One of Mexico's beloved dishes wasn't always considered the best. The birth of birria was created when the Spanish landed in Mexico in 1519 - where they have brought over animals native to the Old World, including goats. An overpopulation of goats soon occurred, and the Spanish decided to give the animals to the natives as they were known for their strong smell and tough meat making the meat worthless to their eyes. The natives soon preparted it with marinade in indigenous styles, making it palatable. The Spanish gave this dish the name "birria" which means "worthless" or "ueseless" in Spanish. Over time, birria's reputation went from being considered worthless to being considered one of the best and favorite dishes in Mexican gastronomy.</p>
        <p>Birria was always traditionally done with goat meat, but in 1950 it went through a transformation. A taquero named Guadalupe Zarata moved from his home state of Puebla to Tijuana, where his stand sold tacos de asada and al pastor. Zarata decided to make beef birria tacos to sell alongside his other two, as goat meat at the time was more expensive and less fatty. After adding more liquid to the stew, the dish became known as Tijuana-style beef birria tacos. Tacos de birria exploded in popularity in not only the rest of the city but also throughout the repulic as other cities and states went to replicate the dish for their own stands.</p>
        <p>Tacos de birria received an evolution of their own as their home city in the 2010s as stands started to add cheese to them; becoming quesabirrias. Quesabirrias not only took the city by storm, but eventually even the US. In the mid-2010s, birria ramen was born in Mexico Coty in the late restraunt Animo. The fusion is made with cooking an instant ramen with birria consommé, topped off with beef, onion, cilantro, and salsa. Birria is a truly ever-changing dish, where its limited by the creativity and willingness of the cook.</p>

        <h2>Steps to prepare birria</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dried Chili Paste:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Remove the stems and seeds from the dried chili peppers.</li>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Toast them lightly in a dry skillet over medium heat for a few seconds on each side.</li>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Place the toasted chilies in a bowl and cover them with hot water. Allow them to soak for about 20-30 minutes until they become soft and pliable.</li>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Drain the chilies, reserving some of the soaking liquid, and transfer them to a blender or food processor.</li>
                    <li class="mini-list-item">Add minced garlic, vinegar, and a bit of the soaking liquid. Blend until you have a smooth paste.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Marinate the meat:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Place the meat chunks in a large bowl and season them with salt.</li>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Rub the dried chili paste all over the meat, ensuring it's evenly coated. Add cumin, cloves, black pepper, and bay leaves for additional flavor.</li>
                <li class="mini-list-item">If using, add chopped tomatoes and onions for extra depth of flavor.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Refrigerate:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate the marinated meat for at least 2-4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the meat to absorb the marinade.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Cooking the Birria:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Preheat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add a bit of cooking oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Once the oil is hot, add the marinated meat and sear it until it's browned on all sides. This step helps develop flavor.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Slow Cooking:</strong> Cook the birria for 2-4 hours, or until meat is tender</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Garnishes and Sides:</strong>Dice cilantro, onion, lemon, and any other toppings you may add.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>
        </ol>
