    <h2 class="sec-header birria">Description</h2>
    <p class="para">Birria is a traditional Mexican dish with a rich history that dates back several centuries. Its origins can be traced to the state of Jalisco, specifically in the region around the city of Guadalajara. It is believed to have been influenced by Spanish culinary techniques, as well as indigenous cooking methods. The word "birria" itself likely derives from the Spanish term "birria de res," referring to a poor-quality or undesirable cut of meat. Over time, however, birria has evolved into a beloved and revered dish in Mexican cuisine.</p>
    <p class="para">The preparation of birria centers around the use of marinated and slow-cooked meat, often goat or lamb, although beef is also commonly used. The meat is typically marinated in a combination of dried chili peppers, vinegar, various spices like cumin and cloves, and sometimes tomatoes, creating a flavorful and aromatic mixture. This marinade not only imparts a distinctive taste to the meat but also contributes to its tenderization during the slow cooking process. The dish is traditionally cooked in large earthenware pots or on open flames, allowing the flavors to meld together over a long period, resulting in a tender, succulent meat.</p>
    <p class="para">Birria holds great significance in Mexican culture and is often associated with celebratory occasions and family gatherings. It is a popular choice for special events such as weddings, baptisms, and holidays. Additionally, birria has become a staple street food in many parts of Mexico, where vendors serve it in various forms, including tacos, quesadillas, and consommé (a flavorful broth made from the cooking juices of the meat). Its popularity has also spread beyond Mexico's borders, with birria gaining recognition and appreciation in the United States and other countries with Mexican communities.</p>
    <p class="para">In recent years, birria has experienced a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to its presence on social media platforms and the rise of food trends. The dish has been embraced by chefs and home cooks alike, leading to creative interpretations and fusion dishes that incorporate birria's flavorful elements. Overall, birria stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of traditional Mexican cuisine, showcasing the melding of indigenous, Spanish, and regional influences into a dish that continues to captivate palates around the world.</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Remove the stems and seeds from the dried chili peppers.</li>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Toast them lightly in a dry skillet over medium heat for a few seconds on each side.</li>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Place the toasted chilies in a bowl and cover them with hot water. Allow them to soak for about 20-30 minutes until they become soft and pliable.</li>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Drain the chilies, reserving some of the soaking liquid, and transfer them to a blender or food processor.</li>
                <li class="mini-list-item">Add minced garlic, vinegar, and a bit of the soaking liquid. Blend until you have a smooth paste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Marinate the meat:</strong></li>
